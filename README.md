# Suzuki-Kasami-Mutual-Exclusion-Distributed-System
This project implements a visualization of the Suzuki Kasami Algorithm in Java, with communication between processes implemented using RabbitMQ. The Suzuki Kasami Algorithm is a distributed algorithm used for the mutual exclusion problem in distributed systems.

## Usage
1. Start the RabbitMQ server.
2. Run the main class for each Site
